[Phaser](http://phaser.io) is a JavaScript game library I've been using for a
bit.  It's excellent, but doesn't have the kind of beginner documentation I like
to read, so I figured I'd create some.  This will cover how to use Phaser to
create a game.

This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML.
